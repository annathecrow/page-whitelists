New version checklist
=====================

* readme.txt
	"Stable tag: x.y.z"
* page-whitelists.php
	"Version: x.y.z" (in the WP comment block up top)
* README.md
	"Stable version: 3.0.3" 
	(not necessary for the WP version system)
* commit new code in svn
	- do `svn up` (to make sure the repo is up-to-date)
	- copy new code to the repo
	- do `svn stat` (to see that the code has been modified)
	- do `svn diff` (to see the changes)
	- do `svn ci -m "commit message"` (= the commit)
* tag new version in svn
	- do `svn cp trunk tags/x.y.z` (creates the new tag)
	- do `svn ci -m "tagging version x.y.z"` (commits the change)
